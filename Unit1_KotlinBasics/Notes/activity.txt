An Activity provides the window in which your app draws its UI.
Typically, an Activity takes up the whole screen of your running app. 
Every app has one or more activities. 
The top-level or first activity is often called the MainActivity
 and is provided by the project template. 

in MainActivity code, you need to provide details on the Activity's layout 
and how the user should interact with it.

For example, in a photo gallery app, you could have 
an Activity for displaying a grid of photos, 
a second Activity for viewing an individual photo, 
and a third Activity for editing an individual photo.
